# My Cyberpunk_2077-Mod_ProjecTT_Files
This Repo contains all of my active and several abandoned modding projects for Cyberpunk 2077.

If you reference these files, please note that:
- I'm not a programmer by trade. Even the working mods here may be badly made.
- Some of these are in active development at any time. They may not work if you take them from here.
- Most of these are a broken unfinished mess that I'll never fix or finish for various reasons

While the licence this is published under doesn't cover it, I very well would like to be asked if you're going to reuse large parts of my work without changing its character (without using it for something else, basically).
